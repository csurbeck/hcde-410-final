This report contains findings as they pertain to the analysis of two public datasets: greenhouse gas emissions in the state of Washington and Big Wildfires over the years in Washington State. The purpose of this study was to see if any substantiative relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and wildfire damage to the state of Washington could be observed. While, with the research, I did not find any interesting relationship between greenhouse gas emission levels and the amount of damage done annually by wildfires, I was able to consider each dataset on it's own and draw interesting conclusions about the nature of greenhouse gas emissions as well as wildfires in the state of Washington.
